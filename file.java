Explanation:
1. The User record, which implements the Serializable interface, can be serialized and deserialized.

2. An instance of User is created and then serialized to a file named user.ser using an ObjectOutputStream.

3. The User object is deserialized from the file user.ser using an ObjectInputStream.

4. The output confirms that the User object has been successfully deserialized, demonstrating the compatibility of Java Records with serialization.

5. This example illustrates the utility of records in Java for scenarios requiring serialization of immutable data structures.
